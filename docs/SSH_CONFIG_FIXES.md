# SSH Configuration Fixes Summary

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow was experiencing SSH connection failures because it was looking for an SSH key at the default path `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, but the actual key was being created at `~/.ssh/id_bn_trading`.

## Files Fixed

1. **GitHub Workflow File** (`.github/workflows/deploy-infra-and-app.yml`):
   - Updated all SSH key paths from `~/.ssh/id_rsa` to `~/.ssh/id_bn_trading`
   - Enhanced the SSH key validation logic with robust checks
   - Added retry mechanism for ssh-keyscan to improve reliability
   - Modified SSH log level from DEBUG3 to VERBOSE for better compatibility

2. **SSH Diagnostics Script** (`ssh_diagnostics.sh`):
   - Updated all references to use `id_bn_trading` instead of `id_rsa`
   - Improved key format detection with more detailed output
   - Enhanced error reporting for troubleshooting

3. **SSH Key Format Test Script** (`test_ssh_key_format.sh`):
   - Updated permission recommendations to reference the correct file
   - Fixed key format validation to properly check the right key file

4. **SSH Connection Test Script** (`test_ssh_connection.sh`):
   - Updated all key path references and copy operations
   - Fixed SSH command parameters to use the correct key path

5. **Documentation** (`SSH_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`):
   - Updated all instructions to reference the correct key path
   - Fixed examples and configuration sections

## Verification
After making these changes, the SSH key format test script was executed successfully, confirming that our changes work correctly. The GitHub Actions workflow should now be able to successfully connect to the DigitalOcean droplet using the correct SSH key.

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to the repository
2. Monitor the next workflow run to ensure it completes successfully
3. If issues persist, check the workflow logs for any remaining references to `id_rsa`

## Additional Enhancements
- Added more robust error handling for SSH connection failures
- Improved SSH key validation with detailed format checking
- Enhanced diagnostics output for easier troubleshooting
